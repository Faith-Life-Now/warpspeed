<h3>What does this website do?</h3>
<p>
    It uses the Google Analytics real-time data API to get the locations of the users acccessing your website, and displays them
    on a full-screen map as a heatmap (i.e. colors indicating the # of people at given location).  Here is a sample of what it will
    look like in action:
</p>

<p class="text-lg-center"><a href="/index.html"><img style="max-width:30rem;" src="/images/tv.png" alt="Heatmap.TV in action" title="Heatmap.TV in action" /></a></p>

<h3>How is this different from the real-time view in the Google Analytics console?</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Heatmap.TV support multiple GA accounts/properties/views simultaneously on a single map.</li>
    <li>Heatmap.TV show the exact locations, not just the countries.</li>
    <li>Heatmap.TV looks good on a big-screen TV.</li>
    <li>Heatmap.TV will auto-start the map after you have logged in once: perfect for browser bookmarks.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How often does the map update?</h3>
<p>Once per minute.</p>

<h3>Will it run forever?</h3>
<p>In theory, yes.  In practice, no.  Google will occasionally (perhaps once a week) want you to re-login.  And there
seem to be browser issues (at least in Chrome on Windows) that crash ("Awww Snap") after a few days.</p>

<h3>Why do I need to login to Google?</h3>
<p>In order to access your Google Analytics data, you need to be logged in to a Google Account that can read the appropriate Google Analytics
account/property/view.</p>

<h3>Will it work if I am not using Google Analytics on my websites?</h3>
<p>No</p>

<h3>Is my data safe?</h3>
<p>Your data is only accessed by the browser, not by the Heatmap.TV server (tech tidbit: it is a static website).</p>

<p>If you are concerned about the security of the PC or TV showing the map, I recommend making a dedicated user
in Google Analytics with read-only permission to just the accounts/properties/views that you want to display on the TV.</p>

<p>At my work, for example, we created a new user <code>lobbytv@example.com</code> with rights to GAnalytics views of our production-ready
websites.</p>

<p>Note: the logout button only logs you out from Heatmap.TV.  It does <i>not</i> log you out of your Google Account.</p>

<p>If you want to revoke GA permissions from Heatmap.TV, you can do so on Google's <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/u/1/permissions">App Permissions</a> page.</p>

<h3>Why is there a limit of 10 properties?</h3>
<p>Google has a 10 hits/minute rate-limit on the real-time analytics API.  I am considering ways around this that would not increase the
refresh interval.</p>

<h3>How can I run this without a dedicated PC for my TV?</h3>
<p>A "stick" computer will work as long as it has a fully-functional browser.  The <a href="http://amzn.to/2yq4SqB">ASUS ChromeBit</a> (which runs
Google's ChromeOS) is a good choice.  If you prefer Windows, the <a href="http://amzn.to/2gGs1fe">Intel Compute Stick</a> or <a href="http://amzn.to/2xGXq6N">similar</a>
should work fine.  I recommend getting a <a href="http://amzn.to/2zaChTN">wireless keyboard</a> as well.</p>
